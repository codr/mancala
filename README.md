## Game rules

- The Mancala 'board' is made up of two rows of six holes each.
- Four pieces -- marbles or stones -- are placed in each of the 12 holes.
- Each player has a 'store' to the right side of the Mancala board.
- The game begins with one player picking up all of the pieces in any one of the holes on his side.
- Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the stones in each hole until the stones run out.
- If you run into your own store, deposit one piece in it. If you run into your opponent's store, skip it.
- If the last piece you drop is in your own store, you get a free turn.
